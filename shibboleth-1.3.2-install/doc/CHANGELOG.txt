Changes in 1.3.2
--------------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
611 - Scriptlet and SAML2PersistentID attribute definition handle CDATA and whitespace better
622 - Attribute resolver errors out properly when value handlers can not properly convert data (this led to malformed SAML being returned)
623 - ScopedStringValueHandler stringify values before attempting to append scope
     - Include missing jar's in IDP_HOME

Changes in 1.3.1
--------------------------------------
Bug Fixes:
451 - Exception message not included in log when XML metadata can not be read
453 - Failure to read metadata that contains attributes elements but no values
464 - Rentrancy/threading bug in the CompositeAttributeDefinition
469 - Choosing Tomcat option #2 "manager" bypasses $IDP_HOME installation
473 - JDBCDataConnector using Principal#toString() instead of Principal#getName() when populate principal name in queries
486 - Log case where users provide asymmetric keys to CryptoHandle more explicitly
511 - Fix export of private keys via extkeytool
577 - When evaluting trustworthniess of requestor credentials use the DNS and URI subject alt names when checking key names and provider IDs
      prior only URI was checked against provider IDs
596 - Assertions to unknown SPs should contain the providerId in the Audience during attribute queries
    - Support for CDATA wrapped content in SAML2PersisentID and ScripletAttributeDefinition resolver plugins

New/Enchanced Features:
* JNDIDataConnector:
   - Document how to turn off referral following (necessary for some AD installs)
   - Allow specification of attributes to be returned in query
   - Allow queries that don't return results to not be treated as an error
* JDBCDataConnector:
   - Support for callable statements (stored procedures)
* New attribute resolver plugins:
   - SASLJNDIDataConnector which SASL GSS-API (Kerberos) binds to the LDAP
   - StaticDataConnector allows static attributes to be added to all users
   - ScriptletAttribtueDefinitions allows use of javascript, specified in resolver configuration file, to be used to create/manipulate attributes
* Add support for different keys for cipher and MAC 
* Option to not send assertions to anonymous SPs. This breaks compatability with Shibboleth 1.1 but is inline with Shibboleth 2.0
* Integration of Will Norris's ARP constraint feature
* Assertion IDs now logged
* When evaluating trustworthiness of requestor party credentials (X.509 certificate) the key of the certificate is checked against those keys 
  within the metadata for the requestor.  This includes the keys within certificates emebedded in the metadata or "raw" keys (expressed as 
  DSAKeyValue/RSAKeyValue elements within the KeyInfo).  This supports renewal, without rekeying, of certificates without changing of metadata 
  and is inline with Shibboleth 2.0 trust policy.
* Support for clustering within a container form-based authentication setup by means of an SSO cookie
* Ability for trap stale requests (usually re-issued by use of the browser back button) and send the user back to the application
* Option to redirect a user to an error page indiciating an application side error when a request without a "target" parameter

Other changes:
* Removal of InQueue references
* Modification time of extension files now preserved during copying to output folder
