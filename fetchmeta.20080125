# This script replicates the four UK federation metadata files from
# the master site to a local directory which is in turn served out
# to federation clients.
#
# As well as replication, this script performs integrity checking on
# the files using the embedded digital signature and a copy of the
# federation's signing certificate to make sure that a spurious
# (damaged or subverted) copy of the metadata is never put into service.
